There is an event called CS Seminar: Why Do Students Think They're Bad at Programming? Towards Intelligent Systems to Support Motivation and Learning in CS1(Nell O'Rourke). Day of event: 10/23/2023. Time of event: 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. Event Description: In this talk, I will introduce a surprising motivational challenge in the domain of computer science education: students often think they're bad at programming, even when they are performing well. I will present a series of studies showing that students in introductory courses assess their own programming ability frequently, using criteria that are often misaligned with best practices (e.g. "I should be able to debug quickly based off a first glance"; "I shouldn't have to sit there and think"). Then, I will show how we can use these self-assessment criteria as a lens to better understand student experiences and the ways they approach learning. Finally, I will present research exploring the design of intelligent programming environments that can automatically detect potential self-assessment moments and provide feedback to help students re-frame these experiences. Through this body of work, I will demonstrate the value of conducting research that crosses the boundaries of human-computer interaction and the learning sciences to deeply understand learning contexts and inform the design of novel learning environments.. Event Location: 3514, Mudd Hall ( formerly Seeley G. Mudd Library). Event Speaker: Eleanor O'Rourke.

There is an event called CS Seminar: Reshaping Computer Systems for the New Hardware Landscape (Nikos Hardavellas). Day of event: 10/25/2023. Time of event: 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. Event Description: Modern computer systems have been built on foundations that were devised decades ago. However, computer hardware has changed significantly since then, as have the demands of users. Many of these foundational concepts still serve us well. On several occasions, though, the decades-old customary practice prevents us from realizing better figures of merit, such as higher performance, lower power, lower energy consumption or easier programming. CMOS transistors have served us well for six decades, but severely constrain us today; emerging devices offer exciting new opportunities. Memory systems were conceptualized in the ‘60s, but struggle to harness the capabilities of contemporary technologies; sophisticated users and hardware already go to great lengths to circumvent their aged abstractions. Parallel programming is still a formidable endeavor, but no system today, not even a single core, can deliver more than half its peak performance without it. In this talk, I will discuss our efforts to rethink some of the aspects of present-day computer systems and reshape them for the new hardware landscape.. Event Location: 3514, Mudd Hall ( formerly Seeley G. Mudd Library). Event Speaker: Nikos Hardavellas.
